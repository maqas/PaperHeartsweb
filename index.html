                  <P>PaperHearts has partnered with other mental health advocacies and community based organizations. The goal of this is to provide more than enough resources which provides abundant exposure to helpful tools. We acknowledge that what works for one might not work another hence we broaden the scope of mental helath aspects to accomodate different individuals. Despite an individual's background one can get to learn from different sections and grow their mindset to aspects of their life one never focused on. This partnership harbours selfless activities that make one feeling grateful for life and recognise how blessed they are.</P>

                  <P>PaperHearts is keen on ensuring those suffering from mental illness are safe, healthy and protected at home and school.At PaperHearts we rate mental health as highly as physical health because when one is not in the right state of mind then one cannot perform as best as they would in other areas of their life.To engage the mind helps to relieve of any pressures and worries of life and so we partake in fun, helpful and constructive events.We aim to mobilize resources and establish educational programs for community volunteers.A number of events that we have partook in involve tree planting, donations, sports-themed activities, and kaaraoke/happy hour events. </P>
